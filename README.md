This simple website was created as a means to practice the fundamentals of managing a project and its dependencies through Webpack. The CSS styling is minimal, but it is neglected intentionally. Instead, this project gave me the opportunity to practice Webpack, building an application that generates the DOM almost entirely throgh Javascript, and modularization of the Javascript code with the use of ES6 modules.
